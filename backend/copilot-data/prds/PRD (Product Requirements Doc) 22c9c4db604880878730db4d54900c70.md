***TLDR*;** It pays to start with a quick TLDR for your own or your teams sanity. With this doc, we’re going to pretend we’re making a document for a vacation. We need one, that’s for sure. Anyways, the template below is a solid place to start curating all things you wish to do with your product and tracking progress along the way. Good luck and happy building!

## 🌎 Overview

This is where you can add all the glorious information as to why you need a vacation, where you plan on going, how you’ll get there, and the benefit of going. It’s generally a brief explanation, albeit, longer than the TLDR. We can get into the nitty gritty in a bit so for now, just focus on the typical W questions (who, what, when, where, and the notorious why).

## 👷‍♀️ Problem Space (Job to be done)

What is the problem you are trying to solve for users or businesses? Let’s get into that here. For us, we’re feeling burnt out, we need to detach ourselves from the normal day to day for a bit in order to feel refreshed and ready to get back to work. 

With Job to be done applied, it could look like this:

> *As a Technical Program Manager, I want to take a break from my work for awhile, to feel refreshed and avoid burn out.*
> 

You can also think of it like a techie mad-lib: As _____, I want to _____, so that I can ______

## 🚨 Requirements

What are the must-dos in order to churn out a *usable* Minimum Viable Product (MVP)? You’ll see P0, P1, and P2 below. That’s just short hand for ordering priorities. 

**P0** = **Critical | P1 = Important | P2 = Nice to have**

[✅ Kanban Board](PRD%20(Product%20Requirements%20Doc)%2022c9c4db604880878730db4d54900c70/%E2%9C%85%20Kanban%20Board%2022c9c4db604881499a09f6e2e483d562.csv)

## 📊 Success Metrics

What are quantitative or, dare I say, qualitative information are we tracking to ensure this endeavor is a success? It doesn’t hurt to list them out, you could even throw in some aspirational values as goals

- 🛬 Flight arrives on time
- 🏨 Hotel allows for check in on or before our assigned time
- 💰We stay in budget, per day ($X value)
- 🛫 Flight Home departs on time

Of course these are a bit non sensical but you get the point! We’d track more business or user oriented metrics in the real world.

### 🎉 That’s it!

You can choose to use both the tasks list and the Kansan board or just one or none. Make it your own, the best project plan is one you will keep up with 😉 Enjoy and happy building!
